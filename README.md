# UnrealStubs

This repository provides Python stub files for various versions of **Unreal Engine**. 
These stubs enable code completion, static analysis, and improved development experience in IDEs like **PyCharm**, **VS Code**, and others that support Python type hints.

## 🔍 Purpose

Unreal Engine's Python API is dynamically generated at runtime and not fully documented in a statically typed format. These stubs:

- Provide type hints and vanilla method signatures
- Improve auto-completion and linting
- Help with writing maintainable and IDE-friendly Python code for Unreal Engine projects


Inside each version folder you'll find:
- `unreal.py`
